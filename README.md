## Overall Learning 

"Throughout this internship, I have transitioned from foundational concepts to advanced offensive security techniques. I began by establishing a secure testing infrastructure using virtualization and Kali Linux. I developed proficiency in the initial phases of hacking, including footprinting via OSINT and performing detailed network scans to map attack vectors.




I progressed to exploiting system vulnerabilities using the Metasploit Framework and executing complex post-exploitation activities such as privilege escalation and log clearing to simulate real-world attack scenarios. My training expanded into specialized areas, including Web Application Pentesting (focusing on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities like SQLi and XSS) and Active Directory Pentesting, where I performed advanced attacks like Kerboasting.





Finally, I solidified my understanding of network defense by studying malware behavior, cryptography, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks. The internship concluded with the application of these skills in practical projects and the preparation of professional vulnerability reports using industry standards like CVSS."

<p><strong><a href="#project1">Project 1:</a></strong> &lt;Cryptify&gt;</p>

</div>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Cryptify </h3>
<p>
 The project is situated in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, where traditional cryptographic standards (like RSA and ECC) are becoming vulnerable to the looming threat of quantum computing. Cryptify is developed as a proactive security tool that integrates Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into a practical, user-friendly application. It leverages the liboqs library, which provides implementations of algorithms evaluated by NIST for quantum resistance. The context of the project is to provide a "Lock it down" solution that is not only effective against current classical threats but is also "future-proofed" against quantum-scale decryption attempts.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->

Beyond the technical curriculum, the internship included vital Life Skills Training (LST) and Soft Skills Training (SST) sessions that bridged the gap between academic knowledge and industry expectations. I participated in workshops focused on Professional Communication, which enhanced my ability to articulate technical findings clearly and maintain workplace etiquette. A significant portion of the training was dedicated to career development, specifically optimizing my LinkedIn profile for personal branding and structuring my GitHub repository to effectively showcase my technical projects as a proof of work. Additionally, I learned to leverage Artificial Intelligence tools ethically to boost productivity and problem-solving efficiency. These sessions collectively improved my professional presence, time management, and readiness to adapt to the collaborative and fast-paced environment of the cybersecurity industry.

## **Community Services**

<!-- add descreption in your own words -->

Believing that professional growth must be accompanied by social responsibility, I actively participated in three key community service initiatives during my internship. First, I volunteered for Blood Donation, recognizing the critical importance of contributing to emergency healthcare and supporting those in medical need. Second, I engaged in an Environmental Conservation drive by planting trees, aiming to contribute towards a greener planet and sustainable ecological balance. Finally, I dedicated time to serving senior citizens, which provided me with the opportunity to offer companionship and support to the elderly. These experiences instilled in me a deep sense of empathy, civic duty, and the realization that technology and progress must ultimately serve the welfare of society.

### **Activities Involved**
**Tapa,Bathinda,Punjab**
- **Blood Donation** – Donated blood and supported basic assistance tasks during the camp.
  
 **Panjuana,Sirsa,Haryana**
